# Introduction

# Data Description

# Analysis

### Question 1

Brief introduction to the questions of interest and the setting of the problem.

#### Restatement of the Problem

(Where did the data come from? How big is it? How many observations? Where can we find out more? What are the specific variables that we need to know with respect to your analysis?)

#### Build and Fit the Model

#### Checking the Assumptions

Residual Plots Influential point analysis (Cook's D and Leverage) Make sure to address each assumption.

#### Comparing Competing Models

Adj R2 Internal CV Press

#### Parameters

Estimates Interpretation Confidence Intervals

#### Conclusion

A short summary of the analysis.

Load required libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
```

Read training and test data and perform any cleaning steps
```{r}
housesTrain = read_csv("train.csv")
housesTest = read_csv("test.csv")

# Remove ID column
housesTrain = select(housesTrain, -Id)
housesTest = select(housesTest, -Id)

# Majority of Alley's are NA, so they can be removed
housesTrain = select(housesTrain, -Alley)
housesTest = select(housesTest, -Alley)

# Drop Utilities as all but 1 are "AllPub". Drop PoolQC, Fence, MiscFeature, FireplaceQu, and LotFrontage, as many are missing
housesTrain = select(housesTrain, c(-Utilities, - PoolQC, -Fence, -MiscFeature, -FireplaceQu, -LotFrontage))
housesTest = select(housesTest, c(-Utilities, - PoolQC, -Fence, -MiscFeature, -FireplaceQu, -LotFrontage))

# MoSold should be a factor instead of integer
housesTrain$MoSold = factor(housesTrain$MoSold, levels = seq(1,12))
housesTest$MoSold = factor(housesTest$MoSold, levels = seq(1,12))

# Log of SalePrice should be used to reduce the variance and better approximate a normal distribution
housesTrain$SalePrice = log(housesTrain$SalePrice)

```
